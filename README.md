# Resume for React/Web3 Development

This project is designed to highlight and emphasize my strengths and experience as a React and Web3/Blockchain developer. 

## Front-end stack

- CRA Typescript template
- styled-components (compiled css/sass framework for modular styling and theming)
- styled-system (custom component props for inline style adjustments and polymorphic component functionality)
- framer-motion (performant custom animation and gestures)
- react-router-dom
